<div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Data and Methodology</h1><h2 data-label="241179" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data</h2><div>The primary data sources was a dataset of incidents responded to by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) between the years of 2013 and 2015, as accessed from the New York City Open Data Portal. Incidents in the data categorized as a gas leak (related to natural gas or liquid petroleum gas (LPG)) were aggregated at the zip code and census tract level. In this data set, basic geographic identifiers including the zip code and road segment level were provided. To use the geographical data for this research, first, the number of leaks per zip code were calculated for years 2013, 2014, and 2015. This zip code aggregation created 195 data points. &nbsp;Next, the authors associated the gas leak data at the census tract level using a similar technique because the zip code level prediction could not provide the level of insight required for this research. Due to &nbsp;the FDNY gas leak data not providing a specific street  address location for each incident, nor census tract geographic identifiers, the authors used the road name and zip code from each incident to aggregate the data to a specific road segment. Next, a .shp file of all New York City roads was analyzed to create one or more road segments for each road in New York City. If a road was located in a single zip code, only one segment would be created. However, if a road crossed two or more zip codes, the road segment would be split at each zip code boundary, resulting in the number of road segments equal to the number of zip codes the road crossed. For each newly created road segment-zip code feature, a small buffer was created to allow for geographic association.</div><div></div><div>When the procedure was completed, 94% of the road name-zip code aggregations were associated with the road segment buffers mentioned above. The buffers were then overlaid on census tracts for New York City’s five boroughs. A geo-spatial intersection was performed to determine the number of census tracts intersected by each road segment buffer. By determining the census tracts intersected by each road segment, the authors decided to evenly distribute the gas leaks among all census tracts. This operation can be seen in Figure 1. Since multiple road segments can pass through the same census tract, there will be multiple frequencies associated with each tract. Sums for all aforementioned census tract frequencies were calculated to provide the authors with the number of gas leaks per census tract for the years of 2013, 2014, and 2015. The authors census tract aggregations produces 2,163 data points.</div><div></div><div><b><img></b></div>
