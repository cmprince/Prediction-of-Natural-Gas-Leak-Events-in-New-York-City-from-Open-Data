<div></div><h2 data-label="207714" class="ltx_title_subsection">Methodology</h2><div>The author's research idea was to investigate whether&nbsp;analytical models that are trained and calibrated on 2013-2014 data will more accurately predict 2015 gas leaks than a naive guess. Our working null hypothesis was  there would be&nbsp;no significant improvement with the given model than a naive method. The authors defined the naive method to be the average number of actual gas leaks (per zip code or tract) in the 2013-2014 data. This annual average would be the predicted number of gas leaks in 2015. Our target prediction value was the number of leaks per building unit (per zip code or tract). For final model evaluation, the authors chose to use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predicted leaks per building unit relative to actual. For the zip code level data, the authors compared predictions to actual number of leaks; however since that data was not available at the tract level, the authors compared predicted leaks to the number of leaks calculated using the road segment approach described above. RMSE is scale-dependent, so while it would not be appropriate for comparing the effects of non-scaled variables, it is appropriate for comparing model performance on the same dataset.</div><div></div><div>Several models were implemented: linear regression, linear regression with Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L1) regularization, and recursive linear regression to identify maximal information coefficient (and cross-validated). [NATE: can you elaborate on this in plain english? Not sure I can explain...]. A random forest model and a simple multi-layer perceptron neural network were also implemented.</div><div></div><div>Each model was initially trained on 2013 data, using 2013 gas leaks as the target variable to properly weight model parameters. They were then cross-validated by predicting 2014 gas leaks using 2013 features, with the assumption that a true predictive model would have only the previous years' data to predict the next year's leaks. In this manner, each model was optimized by tuning hyper-parameters (such as specific features selected with linear regression or the learning rate and number of hidden units in the neural network). Once sufficiently optimized, each model was tested by predicting 2015 gas leaks using 2014 features and compared based on overall RMSE.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="845242" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results</h2><div>Tables 1 and 2 and figures {INSERT FIG NUMBERS} give visual and tabular performance indicators for each of the models. &nbsp;At the zip code level and the census tract level, the naive model boasted the lowest overall RMSE, with 0.002446 at the zip code level and 0.3173 at the census tract level. &nbsp;[WE SHOULD INCLUDE SOMETHING ABOUT THE PATTERNING AND WHAT WAS PICKED UP BY THE NN and RF MODELS]</div><div></div><div></div><div><table data-toggle="context" data-target="#tableContextMenu" class="ltx_tabular ltx_tabular_fullpage"><caption>Table 1: Top Model Performance (Zip Code Level)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Model</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Total RMSE</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Naive</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.002446</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Random forest</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.002946</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Ridge regression</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.003661</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Linear regression (all features)</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.003663</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">MLP neural network</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.005156</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Recursive linear regression (select features only)</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">[Nate do you have?

Initial analysis revealed that when the tract-level model predictions were aggregated back to the zip code level and compared, they fared better and indicate an area of further research -- particularly to address whether increasing the granularity of observations in this matter can counter-act the over-fitting that occurs with a small number of observations (such as 195 zips) and large dimensionality (735 features). Additionally, this evaluation metric of total RMSE penalizes extreme values, which influenced models that accurately predicted zips and tracts with little or no gas leaks (a large majority) while drastically under-estimating the top zips or tracts. If our primary goal is to prioritize top tracts, it may be better pursue more precise objectives, like optimizing models based only on specific zips or tracts with a high likelihood of incidents.</div><div></div><div>This plot demonstrates the tendency of the Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network (in green below) to over-fit on the historical data (which is also what comprises the naive prediction, in red below) and how both approaches under-estimate the top zip codes, although the MLP neural network to a lesser extent. More data and better prediction objectives may reveal promising opportunities for neural networks.</div><div></div>
