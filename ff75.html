<div></div><h2 data-label="207714" class="ltx_title_subsection">Methodology</h2><div>The author's research idea was to investigate whether&nbsp;analytical models that are trained and calibrated on 2013-2014 data will more accurately predict 2015 gas leaks than a naive guess. Our working null hypothesis was  there would be&nbsp;no significant improvement with the given model than a naive method. The authors defined the naive method to be the average number of actual gas leaks (per zip code or tract) in the 2013-2014 data. This annual average would be the predicted number of gas leaks in 2015. Our target prediction value was the number of leaks per building unit (per zip code or tract). For final model evaluation, the authors chose to use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predicted leaks per building unit relative to actual. For the zip code level data, the authors compared predictions to actual number of leaks; however since that data was not available at the tract level, the authors compared predicted leaks to the number of leaks calculated using the road segment approach described above. RMSE is scale-dependent, so while it would not be appropriate for comparing the effects of non-scaled variables, it is appropriate for comparing model performance on the same dataset.</div><div></div><div>Several models were implemented: linear regression, linear regression with Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization. Recursive linear regression was also implemented on top features identified through multiple feature selection techniques. Top features were identified through multiple techniques, including  linear correlation, lasso, maximal information coefficient (similar to linear coefficient, but can identify non-linear relationships), recursive feature elimination, and ridge. A random forest model and a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network were also implemented.</div><div></div><div>Each model was initially trained on 2013 data, using 2013 gas leaks as the target variable to properly weight model parameters. They were then cross-validated by predicting 2014 gas leaks using 2013 features, with the assumption that a true predictive model would have only the previous years' data to predict the next year's leaks. In this manner, each model was optimized by tuning hyper-parameters (such as specific features selected with linear regression or the learning rate and number of hidden units in the neural network). Once sufficiently optimized, each model was tested by predicting 2015 gas leaks using 2014 features and compared based on overall RMSE.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="845242" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results</h2><div>Tables I and II and Figures <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{576363}</span> and <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{508370}</span> give visual and tabular performance indicators for each of the models. &nbsp;At the zip code level and the census tract level, the naive model boasted the lowest overall RMSE, with 0.002446 at the zip code level and 0.3173 at the census tract level.</div><div></div><div></div><div><table data-toggle="context" data-target="#tableContextMenu" class="ltx_tabular ltx_tabular_fullpage"><caption>Top Model Performance (Zip Code Level)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center"><b>Model</b></td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center"><b>Total</b> <b>RMSE</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Naive</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.002446</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Random forest</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.002946</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Ridge regression</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.003661</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">Linear regression (select features)</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.003663</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">MLP neural network</td> <td class="ltx_framed ltx_align_center">0.005156</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div>
