<div></div><h2 data-label="207714" class="ltx_title_subsection">Methodology</h2><div>Our research idea was to investigate whether&nbsp;analytical models that are trained and calibrated on 2013-2014 data will more accurately predict 2015 gas leaks than a naive guess. Our working null hypothesis was there there would be&nbsp;no significant improvement with the given model than a naive method. We defined the naive method to be the average number of actual gas leaks (per zip code or tract) in the 2013-2014 data. This annual average would be the predicted number of gas leaks in 2015. Our target prediction value was the number of leaks per building unit (per zip code or tract). For final model evaluation, we used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predicted leaks per building unit relative to actual. For zip code level, we compared predictions to actual number of leaks; however since that data was not available at the tract level, we compared predicted leaks to the number of leaks calculated using the road segment approach described above. RMSE is scale-dependent, so while it would not be appropriate for comparing the effects of non-scaled variables, it is appropriate for comparing model performance on the same dataset.</div><div></div><div>Several models were implemented: linear regression, linear regression with Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L1) regularization, recursive&nbsp;</div><div><b><div><b><ul><li><div>Linear Regression</div></li><li><div>Lasso Regression*</div></li><li><div>Ridge Regression</div></li><li><div>Random Lasso*</div></li><li><div>Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation</div></li><li><div>Maximal Information Coefficient</div></li><li><div>Random Forest</div></li><li>Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network</li></ul></b></div></b></div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div>The conclusion should reinforce the major claims or interpretation in a way that is not mere summary. The writer should try to indicate the significance of the major claim/interpretation beyond the scope of the paper but within the parameters of the field. The writer might also present complications the study illustrates or suggest further research the study indicates is necessary.</div>
