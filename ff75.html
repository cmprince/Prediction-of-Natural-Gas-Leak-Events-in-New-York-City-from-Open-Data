<div></div><h2 data-label="207714" class="ltx_title_subsection">Methodology</h2><div>Our research idea was to investigate whether&nbsp;analytical models that are trained and calibrated on 2013-2014 data will more accurately predict 2015 gas leaks than a naive guess. Our working null hypothesis was there there would be&nbsp;no significant improvement with the given model than a naive method. We defined the naive method to be the average number of actual gas leaks (per zip code or tract) in the 2013-2014 data. This annual average would be the predicted number of gas leaks&nbsp;</div><div><b><div></div><div>Naive method: average number of actual gas leaks (per zip code or tract) in 2013-2014 predicts average number of gas leaks in 2015.</div>Final evaluation metric: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)</b></div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div>The conclusion should reinforce the major claims or interpretation in a way that is not mere summary. The writer should try to indicate the significance of the major claim/interpretation beyond the scope of the paper but within the parameters of the field. The writer might also present complications the study illustrates or suggest further research the study indicates is necessary.</div>
