<div>with $For the zip code level data, we compared predictions to actual number of leaks; however since that data was not available at the tract level, we compared predicted leaks to the number of leaks calculated using the road segment approach described above. RMSE is scale-dependent, so while it would not be appropriate for comparing the effects of non-scaled variables, it is appropriate for comparing model performance on the same dataset.</div>
