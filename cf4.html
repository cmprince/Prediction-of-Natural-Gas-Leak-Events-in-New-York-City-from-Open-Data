Initial analysis revealed that when the tract-level model predictions were aggregated back to the zip code level and compared, they fared better and indicate an area of further research -- particularly to address whether increasing the granularity of observations in this matter can counter-act the over-fitting that occurs with a small number of observations (such as 195 zips) and large dimensionality (735 features). Additionally, this evaluation metric of total RMSE penalizes extreme values, which influenced models that accurately predicted zips and tracts with little or no gas leaks (a large majority) while drastically under-estimating the top zips or tracts. If our primary goal is to prioritize top tracts, it may be better pursue more precise objectives, like optimizing models based only on specific zips or tracts with a high likelihood of incidents.</div><div></div><div>This plot demonstrates the tendency of the Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network (in green below) to over-fit on the historical data (which is also what comprises the naive prediction, in red below) and how both approaches under-estimate the top zip codes, although the MLP neural network to a lesser extent. More data and better prediction objectives may reveal promising opportunities for neural networks.</div><div></div><div></div>
