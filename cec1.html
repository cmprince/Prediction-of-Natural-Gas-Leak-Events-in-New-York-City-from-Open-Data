While most of these calls resulted in no damage or injury, several incidents did end with fatalities. Infrastructure in Manhattan leaks three to five times more natural gas than cities with newer infrastructure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{gallagher_natural_2015}</cite> and of the 6,400 miles of gas main lines running under New York City's streets, 53% were installed prior to 1960. In 2012, Con Edison experienced 83 leaks for every 100 miles of gas main.&nbsp;Furthermore, replacing a main in NYC can cost from $2.2 million to $8 million per mile, so prioritizing investment is critical.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{forman_caution_2014}</cite></div>
