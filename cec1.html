<div><img></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Data on gas leaks and responses has been recently released and studies have not yet been conducted using publicly accessible data. In New York City, there are currently eighty three leaks for every 100 miles of gas main installed &lt;cite class="ltx_cite raw v1"&gt;\citep{forman_caution_2014}&lt;/cite&gt; and Manhattan gas lines leak three to five times more than other cities &lt;cite class="ltx_cite raw v1"&gt;\citep{gallagher_natural_2015}&lt;/cite&gt;. These authors have researched prediction of gas leaks to prioritize future inspections and develop a risk profile of built environment characteristics using public data.</div><div>In New York City, there were more than 60,000 emergency calls made by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) related to gas leaks between 2013 and 2015. While most of these calls resulted in no damage or injury, several incidents did end with fatalities. Manhattan leaks three to five times more natural gas than cities with newer infrastructure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{gallagher_natural_2015}</cite> and of the 6,400 miles of gas main lines running under New York City's streets, 53% were installed prior to 1960. In 2012, Con Edison experienced 83 leaks for every 100 miles of main.&nbsp;Furthermore, replacing a main in NYC can cost from $2.2 million to $8 million per mile, so prioritizing investment is critical.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{forman_caution_2014}</cite></div>
