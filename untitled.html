<div></div><h1 data-label="302664" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract -&nbsp;</h1><div></div><div>The dangers of natural gas distribution and aging infrastructure are well known, but determining the risk for incidents related to natural gas is a difficult statistical, engineering, and civic challenge. Furthermore,&nbsp;investigating and repairing infrastructure can be prohibitively expensive. We sought to create predictive models that could prioritize future in-person inspections and develop a risk profile of characteristics of the built environment regarding gas leaks. We did this using only publicly-available data and compared several statistical methods to identify an optimal predictive model. We found that given a fairly broad approach to feature selection, a naive prediction based only on historical leaks performed better than more complex models, such as regularized linear regression, random forests, and multi-layer perceptron neural networks. These more complex models did show promise; however, regarding their ability to detect complex structures in the data, improve feature selection and possibly address more precisely defined objectives, such as prioritizing only select geographic areas.</div><div></div><div><img><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{302664}</span></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>In New York City, there were more than 60,000 emergency calls made by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) related to gas leaks between 2013 and 2015. While most of these calls resulted in no damage or injury, several incidents did end with fatalities. Manhattan leaks three to five times more natural gas than cities with newer infrastructure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{gallagher_natural_2015}</cite> and of the 6,400 miles of gas main lines running under New York City's streets, 53% were installed prior to 1960. In 2012, Con Edison experienced 83 leaks for every 100 miles of main.&nbsp;Furthermore, r<span style="background-color: inherit;">eplacing a main in NYC can cost from $2.2 million to $8 million per mile, so prioritizing investment is critical.&nbsp;<i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{forman_caution_2014}</cite></i></span></div><div></div><div>[chloropleth of gas leaks per zip per building unit 2013-2015]</div><div><b><img><img></b></div><div>There have been successful attempts to use statistical analysis on large datasets to assess building risk in general, not just gas leaks. In 2013, the New York City Mayor's Office of Data Analytics (MODA) worked with the FDNY to improve its Risk Based Inspection System. The system is designed to prioritize the inspections of buildings in the jurisdiction of FDNY so as to aid in the detection of severe violations. Prior MODA's involvement, the FDNY model was based on limited data about the city's buildings and weighted simply by anecdotal evidence from firefighters. The improved model uses a statistical regression based on additional building datasets to increase the efficacy of inspections. The model performance went from not being much better than random selection to finding nearly three-quarters of severe violations in just the first one-quarter of inspections.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{nyc_moda_nyc_2013}</cite></div><div></div><div>In a similar fashion, we wish to determine if regression, or another machine learning method, can be used to predict the locations of natural gas leaks as reported to FDNY. &nbsp;We investigate if an effective predictive model for NYC natural gas leaks can be developed using only publicly available datasets. We use multiple data selection strategies and machine learning methods to develop multiple models. We compared the model performance with regard to its ability to predict 2015 gas leaks based upon 2013-2014 data and we identified a few challenges and opportunities for further research.</div><div></div><div>It is important to note that with such a complex set of factors, ranging from the physical state of the gas distribution network and buildings</div><div></div>
