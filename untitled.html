<div></div><h1 data-label="302664" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract -&nbsp;</h1><div></div><div>In New York City, there were more than 60,000 emergency calls made by the Fire Department related to gas leaks between 2013 and 2015. While most of these calls resulted in no damage or injury, several incidents did end with fatalities. The dangers of natural gas distribution and aging infrastructure are well known, but determining the risk for incidents related to natural gas is difficult. Furthermore,&nbsp;investigating and repairing infrastructure can be prohibitively expensive. The authors sought to create predictive models that could prioritize future in-person inspections and develop a risk profile of characteristics of the built environment. They did this using only publicly-available data and compared several statistical methods to identify an optimal solution. They found that given a fairly broad approach to feature selection, a naive prediction based only on historical leaks performed better than more complex models, such as regularized linear regression, random forests, and multi-layer perceptron neural networks. These more complex models did show promise </div><div></div><div>The Data on gas leaks and responses has been recently released and studies have not yet been conducted using publicly accessible data. &nbsp;In New York City, there are currently eighty three leaks for every 100 miles of gas main installed <i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{forman_caution_2014}</cite> </i> and Manhattan gas lines leak three to five times more than other cities <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{gallagher_natural_2015}</cite>. &nbsp;These authors have researched prediction of gas leaks to prioritize future inspections and develop a risk profile of built environment characteristics using public data.</div><div><img><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{302664}</span></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>(Paragraph about NYC data use)</div><div>Manhattan leaks three to five times more natural gas than cities with newer infrastructure.1 Of the 6,400 miles of gas main lines running under NYC streets, 53% were installed prior to 1960 and in 2012, Con Edison experienced 83 leaks for every 100 miles of main.2 Replacing a main in NYC can cost from $2.2 million to $8 million per mile2, so prioritizing investment is critical.</div><div></div><div>In 2013, the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics (MODA) worked with the city's Fire Department to improve its Risk Based Inspection System. The system is designed to prioritize the inspections of buildings in the jurisdiction of FDNY so as to aid in the detection of severe violations. Prior MODA's involvement, the FDNY model was based on limited data about the city's buildings and weighted simply by anecdotal evidence from firefighters. The improved model uses a statistical regression based on additional building datasets to increase the efficacy of inspections. The model performance went from not being much better than random selection to finding nearly three-quarters of severe violations in just the first one-quarter of inspections.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{nyc_moda_nyc_2013}</cite></div><div>In a similar fashion, we wish to determine if regression, or another machine learning method, can be used to predict the locations of natural gas leaks as reported to FDNY. &nbsp;We investigate if an effective predictive model for NYC natural gas leaks can be developed using only publicly available datasets. We use multiple data selection strategies and machine learning methods to develop multiple models.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
