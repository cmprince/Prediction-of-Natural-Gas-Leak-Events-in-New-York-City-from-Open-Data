Examples of an equation, list and citation are also included.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">The purpose of the introduction</h2><div>Most academic introductions follow an ‘inverted pyramid’ structure: they start broad and narrow down to a specific thesis or research question. The introduction should reveal:</div><ol><li>some broad knowledge of the overall topic</li><li>references to related and prior work in the field of investigation</li><li>succinct overview of the major point of the paper</li></ol><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 id="auto-label-subsection-623257" data-label="623257" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data and Methodology</h2><div></div><div>Incidents responded to by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) between the years of 2013 and 2015 acted as a primary data source and was accessed from the NYc &nbsp;Specifically, incidents in the data categorized as a gas leak (related to natural gas or LPG) were aggregated at the zip code and census tract level. Within the gas leak data, basic geographic identifiers at the zip code and road segment level were given. First, the number of leaks per zip code were calculated for years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The zip code aggregation created 195 data points.</div><div></div><div>Next, the authors determined zip code level prediction may not provide the most insight for inspection prioritization, and thus set out to associate the gas leak data at a more granular scale. Unfortunately, the FDNY gas leak data did not provide a specific street number address locations for each incident, nor census tract geographic identifiers. As an alternative, the authors used the road name and zip code from each incident to aggregate the data to a specific road segment.</div><div></div><div>Additionally, a shapefile of all New York City roads was analyzed to create one or more road segments for each road in New York City. If a road was located in a single zip code, only one feature would be created. However, if a road crossed two or more zip codes, the road segment would be split at each zip code boundary, resulting in the number of road segments equal to the number of zip codes the road crossed. Finally, with each newly created road segment-zip code feature, a small buffer was created to allow for geographic association.</div><div></div><div>Finally, 94% of the road name-zip code aggregations were associated with the road segment buffers mentioned above. The buffers were then overlaid on census tracts for New York City’s five boroughs. A geospatial intersection was performed to determine the number of census tracts intersected by each road segment buffer. By determining the census tracts intersected by each road segment, the authors decided to evenly distribute the gas leaks among all census tracts. This operation can be seen in Figure 1. Since multiple road segments can pass through the same census tract, there will be multiple frequencies associated with each tract. Sums for all aforementioned census tract frequencies were calculated to provide the authors with the number of gas leaks per census tract for the years of 2013, 2014, and 2015. The authors census tract aggregations produces 2,163 data points.</div><div></div><div>### insert picture from ppt</div><div></div><div>Figure 1: This figure shows 110th Street, Forest Hills, NY 11375.

The writer should try to indicate the significance of the major claim/interpretation beyond the scope of the paper but within the parameters of the field. The writer might also present complications the study illustrates or suggest further research the study indicates is necessary.</div>
