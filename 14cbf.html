A conventional statistical analysis might focus on correlational relationships, but that is complicated when there is a large number of features and feature selection is non-trivial. Our research intuition is that building predictive models certainly wouldn't address cause and may not shed deep insight into correlational factors for gas leaks, but could add value as applied to prioritizing more deterministic methods, such as on-site inspections.&nbsp;These probabilistic models would prove their worth in terms of accuracy and add value by optimizing the inspection effort. Additionally, as predictive models become more powerful and research with this dataset continues, a predictive model approach could lend insight into important correlations that might be used to develop risk profiles for characteristics of the built environment, such as building type.</div>
